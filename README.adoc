# OCA Github Plugin

The `OpenNMS Contributor Agreement Github Plugin` is a Java Web Application
to help managing the "OpenNMS Contributor Agreements" by handling the according
link:https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/[Github events].

For the link:https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms[OpenNMS Project] each contributor
must sign a so called "OpenNMS Contributor Agreement" (OCA) in order to get the contribution accepted.

The OCA Github Plugin shall make this easier.

Basically the idea is that each time a Github Pull Request is created the `OCA Github Plugin` checks if the contributors of the pull request have signed their OCAs.
If there is no OCA for a user a link:src/main/resources/oca-welcome.md[Welcome Message] is shown.

# Installation

To build the `oca-github-plugin`, invoke

    mvn clean install

After that you can deploy the generated `oca-github-plugin-<version>.war` file to your Java Servlet Container of choice.
We use Jetty 9.2.11.X, but others should work as well.

The `oca-github-plugin` requires a couple of Properties to be set correctly.
Please define a Java System property `property.file` while starting your jetty server to point to a `oca-github-plugin.properties` file.
This can be done, e.g. by modifiing the `jetty.sh` file of your Apache Jetty Distribution:

    -Dproperty.file=/etc/oca-github-plugin.properties

# Available endpoints

## GET /

Should return a "Hello" message, if the service in gernal came up succesful.

## GET /rest/ping

Returns a 200 OK, if the ReST Service is available.

## GET /rest/health

Returns a 200 OK, if the OCA check for user `mvrueden` was successful.
Otherwise 500 is returned.

## POST /rest/payload

The Payload URL of the Github Webhook.
Configure your Webhook to use this resource to send the events to.

# Properties

These properties are supported by the `oca-github-plugin`.
Please put them in the `oca-github-plugin.properties` as described above in
order to change a given default value.


Required properties need to be set manually in any case.
But you may need to set optional properties to get the `oca-github-plugin` to work correctly.

You may also want to have a look at the link:src/main/java/org/opennms/github/plugins/oca/Config.java[Config] java file.

# Interact with the `oca-github-plugin`

image:ulf.jpg[width=125,float=left] In some cases it is necessary to interact with the `oca-github-plugin`.
Not all github users are allowed to interact, only members of the team `OpenNMS/oca-admins` can interact with the `oca-github-plugin`.
To interact with the `oca-github-plugin`, just add a comment to the pull request.
This chapter describes the supported pull request comments.

## Request a recheck of the OCA

If a OCA check fails or a contributor originally hadn't originally signed the OCA and now has,
a recheck of the OCA can be triggered manually. The comment must match the regular expression of property `oca.regep.redo`, e.g.:

  Ulf can you please recheck the contributors OCA?


## Add a custom `github user id` to `email address` mapping

Each git commit has an email address assigned, but not all of the email addresses are known by github.
In this case we do not know the `github user id`.
In order to verify a contributor's OCA we need to know the `github user id`.
The additional mapping file allows us to define those additional mappings.
The comment must match the regular expression of property `oca.regexp.approve` e.g.:

  Hey Ulf, please approve <custom email> as <github id>.

# Open issues

 * The link:src/main/resources/oca-welcome.md[Welcome Message] is shown multiple times for a new contributor.
  This seems to occur when the pull request creator changes the pull request after openening it.
